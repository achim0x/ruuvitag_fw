The Bootloader folder contains DFU bootloader which is used to upload new software to your RuuviTag
without J-Link programmer, you can even use your smartphone and upload software over bluetooth.
Starting from SDK12 the bootloader uses secure, signed packages. The encryption keys used to validate these
software packages is split in two parts: dfu_public_key.c and your private key in "keys" folder.
More details on signing and keys are explained on DFU package creation section.

BSP folder contains "Board Service Packages" which provide abstraction and portability between different boards. If you're interested in creating a custom board, create a custom board header file such as "ruuvitag_b3.h" and add your board header file to "custom_boards.h".

Builds folder contains compiled hexes of applications and bootloader, as well as distribution packages signed with Ruuvi's open private key. 

Drivers folder contains the peripheral drivers such as a driver for SPI as well as drives for sensors on PCB. 

Ruuvi examples has example firmware projects which can be used as a basis for your own application. 
The top-level folder of application contains application code, and there is a subfolder for
each hardware which can run the application. If the application requires softdevice,
create a folder with softdevice name "s132" to let the users know that a softdevice is required.
Configuration folder sets up peripherals and armgcc folder contains makefile and linker script.

Please note that these examples inherit a lot of code from various sources and pay careful attention to 
license and origin of each application.

The SDK folder contains Nordic Software development kit which is used to provide various 
low-level drivers and abstractions to speed up development. We do not host the SDK to reduce the 
size of repository, our makefile downloads and unzips the SDK if it is not present. 

## Developing Ruuvi Firmware

Instructions below are tested using OS X, but basically any Unix distribution (or even Windows) should be fine. If you've compiled and flashed successfully (or unsuccessfully), please identify yourself on our Slack :)

We also host some ready binaries so it's not necessary to setup a development environment if you would be happy to use those. So, please check a `builds` directory first. If you would like to modify the firmware code, continue reading:

### Prerequisites (to compile):

* Download and install GCC https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/+download

Extract the GCC tarball. Other destinations are also ok, but this one is used often:
`sudo mkdir -p /usr/local && cd /usr/local && sudo tar xjf ~/Downloads/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_xxxxxxxx.tar.bz2`

Toolchain path is defined in SDK Makefile, so adding the gcc-arm-none-eabi binaries to path is unnecessary.
*Please remember to adjust the makefile in SDK/components/toolchain/gcc to point at your toolchain install location.* 

### Prerequisites (to create DFU distribution .zip packages)

Instructions how to install (on OS X):

`git clone https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil.git`

`git checkout 1_5_0`

`cd pc-nrfutil`

`curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py`

`sudo python get-pip.py`

`sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

`sudo python setup.py install`

`nrfutil version`
`> nrfutil version 1.5.0`

To get started you can try:

`nrfutil pkg generate --debug-mode --application app.hex --key-file key.pem app_dfu_package.zip`
Debug mode skips various version checks which is useful for development. Packages have to be signed,
RuuviTag ship with bootloader that accepts packages signed with _keys/ruuvi\_open\_private.pem_.

More examples and details can be found at [nrfutil repository](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil).

# Compiling

`make` downloads Nordic Semiconductor's nRF52 SDK and extracts it. First time use will probably fail as SDK Makefile defines the path of toolchain, and the default path might differ from your system. 

Modify $SDK/components/toolchain/gcc/Makefile.posix (on Linux and OSX) or Makefile.windows on windows
to point to your gcc-arm install location. 

You need also add support for secure bootloader elliptic curve cryptography by installing micro-ECC inside
SDK, details can be found at [Nordic Infocenter] (https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v12.0.0%2Flib_crypto.html)

Second time running `make` builds all the sources. 
`make clean` cleans the build directories.

For more help, please request an invite to Ruuvi Community's Slack channel by emailing us an informal request: slack@ruuvi.com

# Flashing

If the device is empty (no SoftDevice S132 + bootloader flashed), you need to flash using SWD interface. The easiest way is to use nRF52 development kit (PCA10036 or PCA10040) with embedded Segger. Steps:

Download and install latest J-Link https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html

Start the J-Link from command line by typing:

`JLinkExe -device nrf52 -if swd -speed 1000`

SoftDevice is Nordic Semiconductor's Bluetooth Smart (or ANT) protocol stack. Sources are super secret, but the latest version is always bundled with the SDK. So, let's flash it:

`J-Link>loadfile nRF5_SDK_11.0.0_89a8197/components/softdevice/s132/hex/s132_nrf52_2.0.0_softdevice.hex`

After the SoftDevice is flashed successfully, flash the bootloader:

`J-Link>loadfile bootloader/ruuvitag_b2/dual_bank_ble_s132/armgcc/_build/ruuvitag_b2_bootloader.hex`

After this no cables are needed, ever (unless the device needs to be rescued for some reason)! From now on, the FW (and/or the bootloader and/or the SoftDevice) can be updated Over-The-Air using Nordic's nRF Toolbox (or MasterControl Panel):

https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRFready-Demo-Apps/nRF-Toolbox-App

https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Toolbox

https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-nRF-Toolbox

# If you're a developer, this is probably what you're after:

1. Flash the SoftDevice protocol stack
2. Compile the bootloader (and the application)
3. Flash the bootloader
4. Reset the device
5. Create .zip distribution package (that includes at least the application code)
6. Install nRF Toolbox (Android/iOS)
7. Press DFU OTA button
8. After completed, press it again! And again! No more cables needed ^^
9. Now you can update SoftDevice and/or bootloader and/or application using DFU OTA. Cool, huh?
